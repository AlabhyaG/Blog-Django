Hello Guys!
I made a Blog application with Django, Html, Bootstrap CSS, and CSS.
In this, we can login, create our user id, and can create blogs and can perform CRUD operation on them.
I have used Django authentication system for implementing User authentication.
If you wish to set up this project in your system, clone the repostiory on your system, then create virtual enviroment and install all the requirements mentioned in requirements.txt
